    <h1>Jason Nucciarone's Personal Page!</h1>
    <p>
        Hey there you! Thank you for stopping by to check out my personal page!
        As you can see by the vanilla HTML, this site is still under construction. If
        you are interested in getting in touch with me until I can add some more fancy JavaScript/CSS
        to this page, feel free to shoot me an <a href="mailto:jason.nucciarone@gmail.com">email</a>.
        Also, you can check me out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonnucci/">LinkedIn</a> in the meantime!
